# Installation

First clone this repository and ensure you have node installed. The root folder of this repo is a node project that requires **parcel-bundler**, and of course **Cherry**. If you're planning to modify and re-build the samples found here, you'll need to install dependencies, therefore run:

```sh
yarn install --ignore-optional
```

```sh
yarn run requirements
```

# Running Samples

Each sample is contained within its own folder, each of these folders start with two digits representing the order in which you should try them. Once you decide which sample you'd like to try, to run it just open the index.html file found in the folder.
